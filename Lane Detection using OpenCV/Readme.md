<h2>Overview</h2>

  * The Video/Image undergoes pre=processing which includes
    - Converting RGB into grayscale
    - Apply Gaussian Blur
    - Apply canny to detect edges
  
  * Multiple function were developed where:
    - Function 1 : Assigning Coordinate of line
    - Function 2 : Calculating Slope and line intercept
    - Function 3 : Apply Canny
    - Function 4 : "Draw" the line on the image
    - Function 5 : Mask the area of lane detection
  
  * There is a slight difference on the way the function is written compared to the tutorial but most of it are the same
